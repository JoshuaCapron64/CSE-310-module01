# Overview

By working on this code, I am hoping to refresh my knowledge and understanding of the C++ language, as I had only one semester's worth of C++ beforehand, and that took place two years ago. 

This software will act as a tutorial for users to learn about various modules that can be utilized using C++, specifically variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and lists. When using this software for educational purposes, it is important to run the code, and then follow along in both the code and the output in the terminal, as the code contains many instructions in comments while the output showcases what is supposed to happen as a result of running the code.

With this software, I am hoping to not only refresh my knowledge of C++, but also create a means by which I, or others can easily go back and learn or relearn these basics should the need arise.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

In order to create this software, I used Visual Studio Code, along with the necessary C/C++ extentions. I also used ming64 downloaded with msys64 to get accuss to G++ so that I could build my code into an executable that would allow it to run.

For this project, I relied entirely on the C++ programming language. I also imported the libraries known as "list" and "iterator" in order to use the iterator tutorial near the end.

# Future Work

- I would go back and create an entire tutorial for funcitons and loops, since while I do point out several times whevere I do utilize functions or loops in the code, there is no definitive tutorial found for either of them.
- Provide more features of lists, such as adding or appending to a list.
- Create more examples with my Class.
