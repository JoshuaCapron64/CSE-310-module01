# Overview

By working on this code, I am hoping to refresh my knowledge and understanding of the C++ language, as I had only one semester's worth of C++ beforehand, and that took place two years ago. 

This software will act as a tutorial for users to learn about various modules that can be utilized using C++, specifically variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and one example of a data structure.

With this software, I am hoping to not only refresh my knowledge of C++, but also create a means by which I, or others can easily go back and learn or relearn these basics should the need arise.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
